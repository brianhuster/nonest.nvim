1. Introduction                                       *unnest-introduction*

Imagine that you are in a terminal buffer in Nvim, and you run a command that
opens a new Nvim instance (e.g., `git commit`). Now you have a Neovim session
running inside another Neovim session. This can be confusing and inefficient.

`unnest.nvim` solves this by detecting when it's being run in a nested
session, then it will instruct the parent Neovim instance to open files in a
in the parent Neovim instance.

NOTE: there are some other plugins that do similar thing, like
     `flatten.nvim` <https://github.com/willothy/flatten.nvim>,
     `nvim-unception` <https://github.com/samjwill/nvim-unception>, etc. Please
    make sure you have removed or disabled them before installing this plugin,
     because they can conflict with each other.

2. Usage                                                 *unnest-usage*

This plugin should works automatically. There is no configuration needed.

When you run a command in terminal buffer that would opens a Nvim instance,
     the parent Nvim instance will open a new tab with the same layout as the
    child Nvim instance. The child Nvim instance will be kept until you close
    that new tab. This is usefull when you use commands like `git commit`,
    `git mergetool`, etc

COMMANDS ~

*:UnnestEdit* {cmd}
    Run {cmd} in a Nvim terminal buffer in the current window.
    |cmdline-special| characters in {cmd} are expanded. If it opens a Nvim
    instance with a file path, the file will be opened in the parent Nvim
    instance, and the child Nvim instance will be closed right away.

    As you can see, the behavior is a bit different from the default behavior,
    instead of opening a new tab, this command just opens file in the current
    window, and the child Nvim instance is not kept. This is useful when you
    want to use another terminal file explorer with Nvim.

    Some example usages:

    - Using with `fzf` <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf>: >vim
        :UnnestEdit nvim $(fzf)
<
    - Using with `yazi` <https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi>: >vim
        :UnnestEdit yazi
